We are a group of researchers from different Universities and Institutes researching and sharing topics on group recommender systems.

## The GMAP Workshop series



Since 2022, we propose a way to bring together a research community focusing on Group Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization. Our workshops are part of the UMAP ACM SIGCHI conference.
While we are working on the upcoming workshop, you can check out the previous proceedings:

    1. GMAP 2022
    2. GMAP 2023

## Research Articles

We publish research articles that showcase our latest research, future directions, and ideas on GRS. We use Medium to make these accessible for all.

## Open Source Projects

One of our aims is to gather, maintain, and make accessible GRS projects through GitHub.
